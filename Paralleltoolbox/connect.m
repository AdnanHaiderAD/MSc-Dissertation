%CONNECT  Block-diagram interconnections of dynamic systems.
%
%   CONNECT computes an aggregate model for a block diagram interconnection 
%   of dynamic systems. You can specify the block diagram connectivity in 
%   two ways:
%
% Name-based interconnection
%   In this approach, you name the input and output signals of all blocks 
%   SYS1, SYS2,... in the block diagram, including the summation blocks. 
%   The aggregate model SYS is then built by 
%      SYS = CONNECT(SYS1,SYS2,...,INPUTS,OUTPUTS) 
%   where INPUTS and OUTPUTS are the names of the block diagram external 
%   I/Os (specified as strings or string vectors).
%
%   Example 1: Given SISO models C and G, you can construct the closed-loop
%   transfer T from r to y using
%
%                   e       u
%           r --->O-->[ C ]---[ G ]-+---> y
%               - |                 |       
%                 +<----------------+
%         
%      C.InputName = 'e';  C.OutputName = 'u';
%      G.InputName = 'u';  G.OutputName = 'y';
%      Sum = sumblk('e = r-y');
%      T = connect(G,C,Sum,'r','y')
%
%   Example 2: If C and G above are two-input, two-output models instead, 
%   you can form the MIMO transfer T from r to y using
%      C.u = 'e';  C.y = 'u';
%      G.u = 'u';  G.y = 'y';
%      Sum = sumblk('e = r-y',2);
%      T = connect(G,C,Sum,'r','y')
%   Note that C.u,C.y is shorthand for C.InputName,C.OutputName and that 
%   'r','y' select all entries of the two-entry vector signals r and y.
%
%   Example 3: If you already have specified I/O names for C and G, you
%   can build the closed-loop model T using:
%      Sum = sumblk('%e = r - %y',C.u,G.y);
%      T = connect(G,C,Sum,'r',G.y)
%   See SUMBLK for more details on using aliases like %e and %y.
%
% Index-based interconnection
%   In this approach, first combine all system blocks into an aggregate, 
%   unconnected model BLKSYS using APPEND. Then construct a matrix Q
%   where each row specifies one of the connections or summing junctions 
%   in terms of the input vector U and output vector Y of BLKSYS. For 
%   example, the row [3 2 0 0] indicates that Y(2) feeds into U(3), while 
%   the row [7 2 -15 6] indicates that Y(2) - Y(15) + Y(6) feeds into U(7).  
%   The aggregate model SYS is then obtained by 
%      SYS = CONNECT(BLKSYS,Q,INPUTS,OUTPUTS) 
%   where INPUTS and OUTPUTS are index vectors into U and Y selecting the   
%   block diagram external I/Os.
%
%   Example: You can construct the closed-loop model T for the block 
%   diagram above as follows:
%      BLKSYS = append(C,G);   
%      % U = inputs to C,G.  Y = outputs of C,G
%      % Here Y(1) feeds into U(2) and -Y(2) feeds into U(1)
%      Q = [2 1; 1 -2]; 
%      % External I/Os: r drives U(1) and y is Y(2)
%      T = connect(BLKSYS,Q,1,2)
%
%   Note: Blocks and states that are not connected to INPUTS or OUTPUTS are
%   automatically discarded.
%

%Old help
%CONNECT Connects unconnected block diagonal State Space system.
%   [Ac,Bc,Cc,Dc] = CONNECT(A,B,C,D,Q,INPUTS,OUTPUTS)  returns the 
%   state-space matrices (Ac,Bc,Cc,Dc) of a system given the block 
%   diagonal, unconnected (A,B,C,D) matrices and a matrix Q that 
%   specifies the interconnections.  The matrix Q has a row for each 
%   input, where the first element of each row is the number of the 
%   input.  The subsequent elements of each row specify where the 
%   block gets its summing inputs, with negative elements used to 
%   indicate minus inputs to the summing junction.  For example, if 
%   block 7 gets its inputs from the outputs of blocks 2, 15, and 6, 
%   and the block 15 input is negative, the 7'th row of Q would be 
%   [7 2 -15 6].  The vectors INPUTS and OUTPUTS are used to select 
%   the final inputs and outputs for (Ac,Bc,Cc,Dc).
