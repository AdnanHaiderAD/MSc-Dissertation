The folders 
CinC_ECG_torso : contains raw time series data of the ECG of people's torso

InLineSkate: contains raw time series data of InlineSkate

LocalGlobalFeat: contains the extracted local and global features of the ECG_torso and InlineSkate data sets

Rawdata: containds the same information as CinC_ECG_torso and InLineSkate but in the form of mat files


LocalGlobalkernR : contains the result of applying DTW augmented with the proposed metric on the sequences of extracted features of Cinc_ECG and  InlineSkate  but using different time slices


LocGloR: contains the result of applying DTW augmented with a euclidean metric and window on the sequences of extracted features of Cinc_ECG and  InlineSkate  

basline: contains the result of applying value-based DTW augmented with a euclidean metric and window on the sequences of  Cinc_ECG and  InlineSkate 

The functions:

analysis:gives the accuracy 


DynamicTimeWarping: the  same version of the function in the scripts folder that implements Dyanmic time warping.


featureextract: extracts local and global features from the  UCR time series


patternmatch:%% performs 1 nearest neighbour match after mapping the istance to principal subspace



principalcomponents:extracts  eigenvectors correponding to the principal subspace datamatrix is D by N where N is the number of samples and D is the dimension and D>>N
