READING DATA:
Steps taken so far to read speech files:
1)
Add paths : 
addpath('/afs/inf.ed.ac.uk/user/s08/s0840844/MSc-Dissertation/MFCC/')
addpath('/afs/inf.ed.ac.uk/user/s08/s0840844/MSc-Dissertation/speech_signals/')
addpath('/afs/inf.ed.ac.uk/user/s08/s0840844/MSc-Dissertation/signalExtraction/')
addpath('/afs/inf.ed.ac.uk/user/s08/s0840844/MSc-Dissertation/signalExtraction/scripts/')

To read timit data:
Use readsph as follows 
 [Y fs] =readsph('speech_signals/fcjf0/sa1.wav');

To read TIDIGITS data, use
use readnist as follows
Note:I have edited the parser of the readnist function to make the function compatible with unix commands
 Y= readnist('speech_signals/tidigits/ae/1a.wav');

Also if the path names are not added then one needs to specify the full path names of the file



RUNNING EXPERIMENTS:
No of Male test speakers used :50
No of female test speakers used : 55


 No of test samples : (50 +55)* 9(distinct numbers) *2(no of versions)
