Note: To compare models in the best possible manner, I used a different test set at each experiment. This reduces/prevents overfitting to the test data set.


The folder "MFFCraw" contains :

(MFCCTEST,MFCCtest)--- both files consist of the entire raw test data set tranformed using MFCCs.

(MFCCTraining,MFCCtraining)--both files consist of the entire raw training data set tranformed using MFCCs.

MFCCExpTest: random sampling has been performed on samples from each category under the constraint that we have enough samples from each class. The resultant test set is equivalent to 1/3 the size of the MFCCTEST. 

162 random samples from boys
162 random samples from girls
326 random samples from men
326 random samples from women


MFCCTrainingSampled: only samples from one production is kept. This reduces the size of the overall training set

 


The folder "Rawdata" contains:
Rawdata -- file containing the entire  training data set of raw utterances
RawdataTest-- file containing the raw test data samples.
RawdataTestExp-- Sampled subset of raw utterances from the test set. The size of this set is 1/3 the size of the original.  




The folder RawdataCleaned contains:

RawTestCleaned--The utterances in the test set are cleaned using the filter I created. The filter removes segments corresponding to silence and performs downsampling on the result.
RawdataCleanedExp---The same subset of test samples are chosen equivalent to RawdataTestExp and  MFCCExpTest.
RawTrainingCleanedSamp---All training samples corresponding to a particular production are chosen and filtered.



The folder RawdataSilR contains:


RawdataSilR: The utterances in the test set are cleaned  by removing silence regions and the same subset of test samples as RawdataTestExp are chosen.
RAwdataSilR: The utterances in the training set ae cleaned by removing silence segments and samples of one production are kept.

The folder LocalGlobalFeat contains:

localglobafTraining-- All training samples corresponding to a particular production are chosen and filtered before being converted to 4 dimensional representation that captures information about local and global trends.


The folder MFCC_silRem contains:

MFCC_silRem-- a subset of test utterances which have been converted to MFCC vectors after regions of silence have been removed from the utterances.
MFCCtraining_silRem--All training samples corresponding to a particular production are chosen and filtered before being converted to MFCC vectors.
