Documentation:


reextract(data) ---only keep samples from one production

read_data(data_type)--read raw data from the corpus

whitening()--whitens MFCC vectors in both the test and training set

filterSignal(signal)-- removes segments corresponding to silence and performs downsampling on the result

silencefilter(signal)-detects and removes segments of silence

extractMFCC(data)---extracts MFCC features. 
data: The raw training/test set
%Output: data is 4 by 1 cell where each cell represents data corresponding to a gender.

extractLocalGlobalFeat(data)-- extracts Local and Global features. 
%data: The raw training/test set
%LocGLo: data is 4 by 1 cell where each cell represents data corresponding to extracted local+global features from a particular category.

 DynamicTimeWarp(test_data,training_data)---Runs the DTW algorithm augmented with the euclidean metric to perform Knearest neighbours classification for each test sample in the test set using the training data.

createtestSubset()-- subsamples the tescleanRawData(data)


cleanRawData(data)-- passes filterSignal/silencefilter to each time-series data. `data' is cell where each entry contains samples of a specific gender.t set using a random generator, The algorithm is designed to ensure we have enough sufficient samples from all classes.


polynomialKernel(InputA,InputB,M) ----computes a particular weighted sum of all possible products of M time points
 --in the first slice with M time in the second slice
