The folder "MFFCraw" contains :

(MFCCTEST,MFCCtest)--- both files consist of the entire raw test data set tranformed using MFCCs.

(MFCCTraining,MFCCtraining)--both files consist of the entire raw training data set tranformed using MFCCs.

MFCCExpTest: random sampling has been performed on samples from each category under the constraint that we have enough samples from each class. The resultant test set is equivalent to 1/3 the size of the MFCCTEST. 

162 random samples from boys
162 random samples from girls
326 random samples from men
326 random samples from women


MFCCTrainingSampled: random sampling has been performed on samples from each category under the constraint that we have enough  training samples from each class. The resultant test set is equivalent to 1/2 the size of the MFCCTraâ€Œining. 

 


The folder "Rawdata" contains:
Rawdata -- file containing the entire raw training data set

RawdataTestExp-- Similar to the MFCCEXpTest, the same subset of test samples are chosen. This was done to measure the performance of a baseline DTW algorithm while containing the time complexity    

RawdataTest-- file containing the raw test data


The folder RawdataCleaned contains:

RawTestCleaned--The utterances in the test set are cleaned using the filter I created. The filter removes segments corresponding to silence and performs downsampling on the result.

RawdataCleanedExp---The same subset of test samples are chosen equivalent to RawdataTestExp and  MFCCExpTest. However for each set of experiments we apply the sampling method again to random chose a subset of the test set such that there are :
162 random samples from boys
162 random samples from girls
326 random samples from men
326 random samples from women



RawTrainingCleanedSamp---The same subset of samples from the training set is chosen similar to MFCCTrainingSampled but the raw utterances are cleaned using the my signal filter. 

In the experiments conducted so far: I have been measuring the performance of the performance of baseline DTW using raw 'cleaned' utteranaces against DTW being augmented with MFCC features. Thus within each experiment, the training and test set used by the algorithms is the same. To prevent overfitting to the test set, I have augmented different test sets for each experiment.
