The folder MFFCraw contains :

(MFCCTEST,MFCCtest)--- both files consist of the entire raw test data set tranformed using MFCCs.

(MFCCTraining,MFCCtraining)--both files consist of the entire raw training data set tranformed using MFCCs.

MFCCExpTest: random sampling has been performed on samples from each category under the constraint that we have enough samples from each class. The resultant test set is equivalent to 1/3 the size of the MFCCTEST. 

162 random samples from boys
162 random samples from girls
326 random samples from men
326 random samples from women


MFCCTrainingSampled: random sampling has been performed on samples from each category under the constraint that we have enough  training samples from each class. The resultant test set is equivalent to 1/2 the size of the MFCCTraâ€Œining.
